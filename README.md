# Comparative-brain-asymmetry-study

Clinical and experimental data obtained using a variety of methods have documented the left hemispheric specializations for linguistic and praxis functions. 
To determine the neural substrates for these functional lateralities, I examined the unique structural asymmetries throught a comparative 
study between the human and chimpanzee brain. Specially, I
(1) created a pipeline that allows the segmentation of the chimpanzee brain written in shell script
(2) built computational models for brain asymmetry using MatLab
(3) performing statistical comparative analysis of the human and chimpanzee cohorts in R, MatLab, SPSS, xls.
(4) published the results in top peer reviewed journals in the field.
