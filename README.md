# Comparative-brain-asymmetry-study

Clinical and experimental data obtained using a variety of methods have documented the left hemispheric specializations for linguistic and praxis functions. 
However, the neural substrates for these functional lateralities - the structural asymmetries are still unclear and can be best determined throught comparative 
study between the human and our closest relatives - chimpanzee. In my studies, I aim at investigating the unique brain asymmetry that is specific to the human 
brain, which may shed light on the evolution of our species. This is achieved mainly through (1) modelling brain asymmetry features and (2) performing statistical 
comparative analysis of the human and chimpanzee cohorts.
